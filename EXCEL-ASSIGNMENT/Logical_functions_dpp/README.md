**Q2. Count the number of numeric values in a given range.**  
Ensured only numerical entries were counted, ignoring text and blanks.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=COUNT(range)`

---

**Q3. Find the average score of students who scored above a minimum threshold.**  
Applied conditional averaging to filter eligible records.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=AVERAGEIF(range, criteria)`

---

**Q4. Sort employee data by department (A–Z) and salary (highest to lowest).**  
Organized data using multi-column sorting for better readability.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=SORT(range, {column1, column2}, {1, -1})`

---

**Q5. Identify the second smallest revenue value from the dataset.**  
Extracted a ranked value without manually sorting the data.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=SMALL(range, 2)`

---

**Q6. Count the number of employees working in a specific department.**  
Used conditional counting based on department criteria.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=COUNTIF(range, criteria)`

---

**Q7. Calculate total sales where units sold exceed a given number.**  
Applied conditional summation to filter sales performance.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range)`

---

**Q8. Find the highest price among items marked as available.**  
Combined condition checking with maximum value extraction.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=MAXIFS(max_range, criteria_range1, criteria1)`

---

**Q9. Count employees from the HR department earning above a specific salary.**  
Used multiple conditions to narrow down qualifying records.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, criteria_range2, criteria2)`

---

**Q10. Calculate the average sales for items priced within a defined range.**  
Applied multi-criteria filtering to compute an accurate average.  
**Formula Structure:**  
`=AVERAGEIFS(average_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, criteria_range2, criteria2)`
