## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open **MySQL Workbench** (or any MySQL client)
2️⃣ Create a new SQL tab
3️⃣ Run `mysql_distinct_limit_orderby_optimization.sql`
4️⃣ Execute queries **section by section** to understand outputs

---

## 📊 Final Output (Expected State)

📁 After execution, the queries return:

* Clean **distinct product lists**
* **Top-selling products**
* **Recent order insights**
* Optimized results suitable for **large datasets**

No schema changes are made — this assignment is **read-only and analysis-focused**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

💡 Write readable, interview-ready SQL
💡 Avoid unnecessary `DISTINCT` usage
💡 Use `GROUP BY` for scalable queries
💡 Understand indexing and execution plans
💡 Think like a data analyst, not a query typist

## ⚠️ Notes (Important)

⚙️ Queries assume an existing `orders` table
🚫 This is **not a database design assignment**
📘 Focus is on **data retrieval and optimization**, not CRUD
⚠️ Some queries are intentionally written in multiple ways to compare performance
