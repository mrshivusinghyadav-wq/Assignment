# 🗄️ SQL Functions – Practice Assignment

📌 A **MySQL-based SQL assignment** focused on applying **core SQL functions, aggregation, grouping, and analytical queries**
using **World** and **Sakila** sample databases.

🎯 Designed to demonstrate **practical SQL problem-solving skills** required for **Data Analyst, Data Science, and Backend**
entry-level roles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Apply aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`
✅ Use grouping and filtering with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
✅ Perform analytical queries on real-world datasets
✅ Derive business insights from relational databases
✅ Write clean, readable, interview-ready SQL

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

🗄️ **Database:** MySQL  
📜 **Language:** SQL  
⚙️ **MySQL Version:** 8.0  
📈 **Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

| 🔹 Section | 📄 Description |
|-----------|---------------|
| 🌍 World Database Queries | Population analysis, density calculations |
| 🎥 Sakila Database Queries | Rentals, revenue, customer behavior |
| 📊 Aggregation Functions | `COUNT`, `SUM` usage |
| 🔎 Grouping & Filtering | `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` |
| 🧠 Business Logic | Real-world analytical use cases |

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open **MySQL Workbench** or any MySQL client  
2️⃣ Load the sample databases: `world` and `sakila`  
3️⃣ Open the file `SQL_Functions_Assignment.sql`  
4️⃣ Execute queries **section-wise** for better understanding  

---

## 📊 Final Output (Expected State)

📁 After execution, the queries return:

* Country with **maximum population**
* Total **city population per country**
* **Top 3 population-dense countries**
* Most active **customers and rental months**
* **Daily and store-wise revenue insights**
* Logical validation of **empty result sets** where applicable

⚠️ Some queries (e.g. customers with exactly 5 payments) may return **no rows**
depending on the dataset — this is **expected and correct behavior**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

💡 Understand how aggregate functions work in real datasets  
💡 Learn to validate business assumptions using SQL  
💡 Handle empty result sets correctly  
💡 Write production-quality SQL with comments  
💡 Think analytically, not mechanically  

---

## ⚠️ Notes (Important)

⚙️ Queries assume **standard World and Sakila schemas**
🚫 No schema modifications are performed
📘 This is an **analysis-focused assignment**, not CRUD
🧪 Output may vary slightly based on dataset version
