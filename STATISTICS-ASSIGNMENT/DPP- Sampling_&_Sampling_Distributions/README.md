
# 📊 DPP – Sampling & Sampling Distributions

This repository contains solutions for the **DPP: Sampling & Sampling Distributions** assignment, covering core concepts in statistical sampling and sampling distributions.

The work is presented in **two formats** to clearly separate **conceptual understanding** from **analytical computation**.
